# Understanding Data Types in Python
# Common Data Types
# Numbers

3, 6, 9  # Integers (int)
3.14 float: Numbers with decimals (like 3.14, -0.2)
Text

str: Sequences of characters, enclosed in quotes ("Hello", 'This is a string')
Booleans

bool: Represents True or False
Examples

Python
age = 25          # age is an integer (int)
pi = 3.14159      # pi is a float
name = "Alice"    # name is a string (str)
is_new = True     # is_new is a boolean (bool)
Use code with caution.
Why do data types matter?

Correct operations: Python needs to know the data type to perform the right actions (you can add numbers, but you can't add a number and a word).
Memory usage: Different data types take up different amounts of space in the computer's memory.
Checking Data Types

Use the type() function to see a variable's data type:

Python
print(type(age))   # Output: <class 'int'>
Use code with caution.

write a very simple  script using basic python data types
Absolutely! Here's a simple script using basic Python data types:

Python

Use code with caution.
How this script works:

Variables: We create variables (name, age, height_meters, is_student) to store different pieces of information.
Data Types: Python assigns the appropriate data types:
name: String (str)
age: Integer (int)
height_meters: Float
is_student: Boolean (bool)
